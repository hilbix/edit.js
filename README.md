# edit.js

Currently this only can remove trailing spaces.

In case I find some other quick function I need, I will add it.


## Usage

	git clone --recursive https://github.com/hilbix/edit.js
	ln --relative -s edit.js/web /srv/www/html/edit


## FAQ

WTF why?

- `kate` has no way to remove trailing spaces (there is only some default for this on save, but this probably is the most stupid implementation ever).
- Hence I started this here, to quickly implement such a beast, as I quite often need to remove traling spaces from some text in the clipboard.
- Because AFAICS the world has gone mad.  All presentations about COVID-19 are not done for a normal being.
- Hence I had to do it myself.  Sigh.

License?

- You are kidding, right?  There is absolutely nothing which can be copyrighted here.  Just strait done in a hurry.  A double no-brainer.
- Hence it is CLL, so free as in free beer, free speech, free air and free baby.
